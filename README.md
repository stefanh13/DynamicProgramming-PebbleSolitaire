# DynamicProgramming-PebbleSolitaire

Description from open.kattis.com:
I bet you have seen a pebble solitaire game. You know the game where you are given a board 
with an arrangment of small cavities, initially all but one occupied by a pebble each. 
The aim of the game is to remove as many pebbles as possible from the board. 
Pebbles disappear from the board as a result of a move. A move is possible if there is a straight line of 
three adjacent cavities, let us call them A, B, and C, with B in the middle, where A is vacant, but B and C each contain a pebble. 
The move consists of moving the pebble from C to A, and removing the pebble in B from the board. 
You may continue to make moves until no more moves are possible.
